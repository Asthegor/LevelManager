# LevelManager
LevelManager is a parser for Tiled Lua exported file.

With it, you can :
- load as many maps as you need (just create a new instance of LevelManager)
- can retreive all objects, layers AND group of layers you need
- can draw the full map or only a part of it

A backup is made for most of the changes you can make (object position, image id, opacity,  etc.)
